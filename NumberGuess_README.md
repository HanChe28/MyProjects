//This is a number-guessing program I created on March 23, 2023.

//The program picks a random number and asks you to enter a number between 1 and 100.

//The program will tell you if the number you chose is too high or too low.

//When you guess the correct number, it will tell you how many guesses it took before you entered correct number.
